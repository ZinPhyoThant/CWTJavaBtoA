/**
 * Bitwise AND	|	Preserves a bit in the result if and only if it exists in both operands.
 * Bitwise OR	&	Preserves a bit if it exists in either of the two operands.
 * Bitwise XOR	^	Preserves a bit if it is present only in one operand but not both.
 * Bitwise COMPLEMENT	~	Also known as 1â€™s complement. Just reverse the bits of the operand.
 * Bitwise LEFT SHIFT	<<	The bits in the left operand are shifted to the left by the number of places specified in the right operand.
 * SIGNED RIGHT SHIFT	>>	The bits in the left operand are shifted to the right by the number of places specified in the right operand.
 * UNSIGNED RIGHT SHIFT	>>>	Exactly like SIGNED RIGHT SHIFT plus shifted bits are filled with zero.
